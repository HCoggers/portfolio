						<h2>Portfolio</h2>
						<p>Challenges are important to me. Working within strict confines, or developing on intricate, complicated problems, that's where I thrive. There's always a way to get exactly what you want with logic and code,  that's why I love it, so let me show off a few mysteries I've solved.</p>

						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>
							Hi, I'm Harry.
							<br />
							I'm a full-stack software developer now, but most of my background is in the arts (Music and Theatre). 
							<br />
							What I really want is to bring my personal affinity for the arts and my own artistic studies into my software development, to create new and innovative platforms for anyone to share  their thoughts, their feelings, and their artistic expression.
							<br />
							I was given some incredible opportunities as an actor, opportunities I wish every person, creative or not, would have the chance to experience. I want to seek out those companies that use software and web technology to provide outlets for everyone, but especially those that work to ensure people who feel insecure or anxious  with face-to-face interactions can express themselves in other ways.
